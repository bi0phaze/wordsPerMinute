Inferno [Hell]
 
Canto I
 
 
<p>ARGUMENT.—The writer, having lost his way in a gloomy forest, and being hindered by certain wild beasts from ascending a mountain, is met by Virgil, who promises to show him the punishments of Hell, and afterward of Purgatory; and that he shall then be conducted by Beatrice into Paradise. He follows the Roman poet. </p>
 
 
<p>IN the midway 1 of this our mortal life,	
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray	
Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell,	
It were no easy task, how savage wild	
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,	        5
Which to remember only, my dismay	
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.	
Yet, to discourse of what there good befel,	
All else will I relate discover’d there.</p>



  <p>How first I enter’d it I scarce can say,	        10
Such sleepy dulness in that instant weigh’d	
My senses down, when the true path I left;	
But when a mountain’s foot I reach’d, where closed	
The valley that had pierced my heart with dread,	
I look’d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad	        15
Already vested with that planet’s beam, 2	
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.	
  Then was a little respite to the fear,	
That in my heart’s recesses deep had lain	
All of that night, so pitifully past:	        20
And as a man, with difficult short breath,	
Forespent with toiling, ’scaped from sea to shore,	
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands	
At gaze; e’en so my spirit, that yet fail’d,</p>



<p>Struggling with terror, turn’d to view the straits	        25
That none hath passed and lived. My weary frame	
After short pause recomforted, again	
I journey’d on over that lonely steep,	
The hinder foot 3 still firmer. Scarce the ascent	
Began, when, lo! a panther, 4 nimble, light,	        30
And cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d;	
Nor, when it saw me, vanish’d; rather strove	
To check my onward going; that oft-times,	
With purpose to retrace my steps, I turn’d.	
  The hour was morning’s prime, and on his way	        35
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars, 5	
That with him rose when Love Divine first moved	
Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope	
All things conspired to fill me, the gay skin	
Of that swift animal, the matin dawn,	        40
And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chased.</p>?	


<p>And by new dread succeeded, when in view	
A lion came, ’gainst me as it appear’d,	
With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,	
That e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf	        45
Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d	
Full of all wants, and many a land hath made	
Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear	
O’erwhelm’d me, at the sight of her appall’d,	
That of the height all hope I lost. As one,	        50
Who, with his gain elated, sees the time	
When all unawares is gone, he inwardly	
Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,	
Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,	
Who coming o’er against me, by degrees	        55
Impell’d me where the sun in silence rests.</p>


  <p>While to the lower space with backward step	
I fell, my ken discern’d the form of one	
Whose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.	
When him in that great desert I espied,	        60
“Have mercy on me,” cried I out aloud,	
“Spirit! or living man! whate’er thou be.”	
  He answered: “Now not man, man once I was,	
And born of Lombard parents, Mantuans both	
By country, when the power of Julius yet	        65
Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past,	
Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time	
Of fabled deities and false. A bard	
Was I, and made Anchises’ upright son	
The subject of my song, who came from Troy,	        70
When the flames prey’d on Ilium’s haughty towers.	
But thou, say wherefore to such perils past	
Return’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount	
Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?”	
“And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,	        75
From which such copious floods of eloquence	
Have issued?” I with front abash’d replied.	
“Glory and light of all the tuneful train!	
May it avail me, that I long with zeal	
Have sought thy volume, and with love immense	        80
Have conn’d it o’er. My master thou, and guide!	
Thou he from whom alone I have derived	
That style, which for its beauty into fame	
Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.	</p>


<p>O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!	        85
For every vein and pulse throughout my frame	
She hath made tremble.” He, soon as he saw	
That I was weeping, answer’d, “Thou must needs	
Another way pursue, if thou wouldst ’scape	
From out that savage wilderness. This beast,	        90
At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none	
To pass, and no less hinderance makes than death:	
So bad and so accursed in her kind,	
That never sated is her ravenous will,	
Still after food more craving than before.	        95
To many an animal in wedlock vile	
She fastens, and shall yet to many more,	
Until that greyhound 6 come, who shall destroy	
Her with sharp pain. He will not life support	
By earth nor its base metals, but by love,	        100
Wisdom, and virtue; and his land shall be	
The land ’twixt either Feltro. 7 In his might	
Shall safety to Italia’s plains arise,	
For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,	
Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.	        105
He, with incessant chase, through every town	
Shall worry, until he to hell at length	
Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.	
I, for thy profit pondering, now devise	
That thou mayst follow me; and I, thy guide,	        110
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,	
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see	
Spirits of old tormented, who invoke	
A second death; 8 and those next view, who dwell	
Content in fire, 9 for that they hope to come,	        115
Whene’er the time may be, among the blest,	
Into whose regions if thou then desire	
To ascend, a spirit worthier 10 than I	
Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,	
Thou shalt be left; for that Almighty King,	        120
Who reigns above, a rebel to His law	
Adjudges me; and therefore hath decreed	
That, to His city, none through me should come.	
He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds	
His citadel and throne. O happy those,	        125
Whom there He chuses!” I to him in few:	
“Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,	
I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse	
I may escape) to lead me where thou said’st,	
That I Saint Peter’s gate 11 may view, and those	        130
Who, as thou tell’st, are in such dismal plight.”	
  Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.</p>
